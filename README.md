# Java-RMI-gRPC-sockets

*Distributed sys Project : 
This project involves developing servers and clients using three distributed communication technologies in Java: Java RMI, gRPC, and sockets. 


*Project Objectives
Implement servers and clients using Java RMI, gRPC, and sockets.


*Specifications of Services to Implement : 

Java RMI: Task Management
-Add a new task to the task list.
-Remove an existing task from the list.
-Retrieve the complete list of tasks.

gRPC: Messaging Service
-Send text messages to a specified recipient.
-Retrieve received messages for a given user.

Sockets: Chat Service
-Send text messages to a common chat room.
-Retrieve messages sent by other users.




*Comparative Report:

In real-world usage scenarios, here's how these technologies could be evaluated:

Java RMI: Useful for internal applications where simplicity of implementation and management of remote objects are priorities, but not suitable for high-performance applications.

gRPC: Ideal for applications requiring fast communication, especially in distributed services, microservices, and applications requiring data streaming.

Sockets: Suitable for applications requiring fine-grained control over communication and for cases where raw performance is an absolute priority, but require more effort for implementation and management.
